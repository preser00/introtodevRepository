every time you open git desktop you should hit fetch origin to see if you have anything to pull from origin

git will tell you if you're trying to push when you haven't fetched (pulled) everything 

git will tell you if there's file conflict (2+ people editing same file) 
- good rule of thumb is to not work on same file at same time, know what partners are working in  
- if you really need to do so you can use branches 
- best practice is to each have your own branch
- however branches have to be merged eventually 

preventing conflict in gamemaker
- ex making own versions of sprites, making separate rooms to test objects in
